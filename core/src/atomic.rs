/// range of data, different strategies are sometimes useful when making the decision
/// between maximizing usage of the buffer, and ensuring a given grant is successful.
///
/// As a short summary of possible grants:
///
/// * `grant_exact(N)`
///   * User will receive a grant `sz == N` (or receive an error)
///   * This may cause a wraparound if a grant of size N is not available
///       at the end of the ring.
///   * If this grant caused a wraparound, the bytes that were "skipped" at the
///       end of the ring will not be available until the reader reaches them,
///       regardless of whether the grant commited any data or not.
///   * Maximum possible waste due to skipping: `N - 1` bytes
/// * `grant_max_remaining(N)`
///   * User will receive a grant `0 < sz <= N` (or receive an error)
///   * This will only cause a wrap to the beginning of the ring if exactly
///       zero bytes are available at the end of the ring.
///   * Maximum possible waste due to skipping: 0 bytes
///
/// These grants might be added in the future:
///
/// * `grant_remaining()`
///   * User will receive a grant `0 < sz <= total_buffer_sz` (or receive an error)
///   * This will only cause a wrap to the beginning of the ring if exactly
///       zero bytes are available at the end of the ring.
///   * Maximum possible waste due to skipping: 0 bytes
/// * `grant_largest()`
///   * User will receive a grant `0 < sz <= total_buffer_sz` (or receive an error)
///   * This function will find the largest contiguous region available
///       (at the end or beginning of the ring).
///   * If the region at the beginning was chosen, some bytes at the end of the ring
///       will be skipped
///   * Maximum possible waste due to skipping: `(total_buffer_sz / 2) - 1` bytes
/// * `grant_largest_max(N)`
///   * User will receive a grant `0 < sz <= N` (or receive an error)
///   * This function will attempt to find a contiguous region up to sz bytes large.
///       If no such region exists, the largest region available (at the end or
///       beginning of the ring) will be granted to the user.
///   * If the region at the beginning was chosen, some bytes at the end of the ring
///       will be skipped
///   * Maximum possible waste due to skipping: `(total_buffer_sz / 2) - 1` bytes
///
/// The following might introduce the concept of "split grants", which provide two
/// separate contiguous buffers in order to eliminate waste due to splitting, but require
/// the user to make writes to each buffer.
///
/// * `split_grant_remaining(N)`
///   * User will receive a grant containing two segments with a total size of
///       `0 < (sz_A + sz_B) <= total_buffer_sz` (or receive an error)
/// * `split_grant_max_remaining(N)`
///   * User will receive a grant containing two segments with a total size of
///       `0 < (sz_A + sz_B) <= N` (or receive an error)
///   * If the grant requested fits without wraparound, then the sizes of the grants
///       will be: `sz_A == N, sz_B == 0`.
/// * `split_grant_exact(N)`
///   * User will receive a grant containing two segments with a total size of
///       `(sz_A + sz_B) == N` (or receive an error)
///   * If the grant requested fits without wraparound, then the sizes of the grants
